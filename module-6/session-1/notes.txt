clean code

naming:
- intention-revealing
- pronouncable and searchable
- meaningful distinction
- one word per concept eg. fetch/get/find
- class and method names

functions:
- small
- do one thing
- limit arguments
- prefer fewer arguments
- have no side effects => nama sesuai apa yg dia lakukan,
ga ngelakuin hal apa2 lg

general principles:
- dry
- law of demeter => a method 'f' of a class C should only
    call the methods of:
        - objects from class C
        - objects created by f
        - objects passed as arguments to f
        - objects held in instance variable of C

- follow conventions
