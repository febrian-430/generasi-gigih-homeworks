smells:
- bloaters: code/method/class yang semakin lama akan jadi susah to work with
- oo abusers: incorrect application of oop
- change preventers: if u need to change smth, u have to make many changes in other place
- dispensables: pointless code
- couplers:

refactor checklists:
- cleaner
- no new functionality
- all existing tests/features must not fail
