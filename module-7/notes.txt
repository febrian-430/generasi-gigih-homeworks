LSP
principle of least surprise:
    - ada raise error
    - unexpected return type
    - side effect dalam method (nama method ga ngejelasin side effectnya)


public interfaces:
    - reveal their primary responsibility
    - expect to be invoked
    - will not change on a whim
    - be safe for others to rely on
    - be documented in tests


jangan ubah state tanpa class
