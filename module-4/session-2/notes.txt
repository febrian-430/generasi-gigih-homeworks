rules (write code seeffisien mungkin)
1. write prod code to pass a failing unit test
2. write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail:
	make atomic test
3. write no more prod code than necessary to pass the one failing test

Ideal git commit for tdd: clean, explanatory, atomic.
1 commit after test is green
1 commit after refactor and green
